CONVENTIONS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Since Wax and DCI bring about several different code locations, there must be a
common convention across the framework for easily identifying method locations.

PersistenceModel Convention:
	$foo = new CouchDBPersistenceModel("doc_id");
	$foo['datavar'] = "bar";
	
	$foo->role_property = "value";
